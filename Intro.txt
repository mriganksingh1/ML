MACHINE LEARNING USING PYTHON

IN THIS REPOSITORY I WILL BE WRITING THE CODES AS WELL AS THE WAY TO USE THE ALGOS ON DATASETS OF MACHINE LEARNING

Machine Learning -> it is a process by which machine learns by its pre exposure to some data
Artificial Intelligence->Smart homes, Smart Car are examples of artificial intelligence
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence
Data Mining -> it is a process in which exposure to a large amount of data is given in order to generate a new information
Data mining can use ML or Data analytics and other ways
There are 3 types of ML->
1.Supervised MachineLearning
2.Unsupervised MachineLearning
3.Reinforced Learning

Supervised Lerning  -> in this there is a predefined output data for some given input data
Unsupervised Learning -> we do not have any predefined output for a given input(i.e perfect example is clustering of people by seeing of patterns)
Reinforced Learning -> Learning through experience like we humans do

SUPERVISED LEARNING

Supervised learning is of 2 types
1.classification
2.regression

Regression-> in regression the output data is in the continuous form and from that if we have to determine output we use regression
classification-> when we have few classes as output and we have to put data in one of these calsses

STEPS FOR SUPERVISED LEARNING

1.Collecting data
2.Loading data and data cleaning
3.Training an algorithm
4.Testing datta

In the data if we give x datapoints then we should not train on y data points and should reserve them as hold on data(data on which algo is to be tested) and train the algo with x-y train data

If the algo works fine on with training data but does not work well with the testing data then it is that the algo is kind of remembering and cramming it which is called overfitting of data.
