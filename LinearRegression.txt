LinearRegression is a Regression type of algorithm which mweans it is very good to predict output on some continuous spectrum of data

It tries to put some linear expression on the given data

it is of type y=m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+b  for some x1,x2,x3
by the given data it tries to figure out m1,m2,m3

COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION 

It is a way to score how near or far is our predicted data from actual data.
It is calculated by the formula 1-(u/v) where u is (summation of (true output-predicted output))^2
v= (summation(true output-mean of true output)^2)

This means we want the score between 0 and 1 . It can be between 0 and -1 also . Higher the score better is the prediction.
